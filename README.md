The purpose of the app is to keep a connection between the members of the family.

For the same, I have tried building an android application, which consists of the following main features-

1.Chat with members
2.Building a todo list for family.
3.Managing monthly expenses.
4.Locating all members of the family.
5.Showing important or emergency contact list.
